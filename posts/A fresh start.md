# 2026

Finally, it's 2026. I'm a little late to the party as it's nearly **March** now. However, I believe the 2020 effect has already worn off for most people, well, at least it's the case for me.

Out with the brief introduction, it has came to my attention that multiple aspects of my life are currently undergoing massive changes. Not only am I going to be moving in a couple of months, the whole situation revolving around my academics is also slightly concerning.

I wouldn't say that my life is falling apart, but undergoing a massive change? That's for sure. I've finally gotten a job as a driver in which help fund my everyday life. Everything else? Well they can step aside before I finally got something figured out.

One major positive aspect would be that I'm no longer feeling "lost". Had I found the path already? No. I'm still in my early twenties. In fact, I just turned 23 this year. However, I do realise that in order to create order, you need to be lost. To know that you're heading towards the right path, you'll need to deviate from it initially. It's okay if things doesn't seem like they're in order, it's these phases that actually makes your twenties, your twenties.

It feels weird to say something like this as a 23 year old. However, I would like to look back on my current situation perhaps one, two, five or ten years from now, and be glad that hey, it wasn't actually half bad as I had remembered it. Heck, I might even have something going on that's entirely thanks to my momentum right now. Anyway, it's safe to say that 2026 is probably *the* starting point for my life in which adulting finally made sense for me.
