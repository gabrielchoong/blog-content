## Job Application

The timing of this blog is about when I was almost graduating from college. The internship / job hunting experience in 2025 is not exactly what I expected it to be. If you're not planning to get a Master's Degree after college, you're automatically entered into a pool of candidates in which everyone would certainly have more experience than you would otherwise have.

The phenomenon of having "too many degree" holders precisely mimics other problems of society. In order for social hierarchy to be stable, we can only allow for a small percentage of people in power, and depending on how wide the base of the social pyramid is, the narrower the pyramid, the more convoluted the top is. Individuals are led by those with status, not competence. The hierarchy protects itself.

The push for college created a problem in which the current social construct weren't ready to adapt. For instance, when the bottom two layers of the pyramid merged together, either (1) every person in the bottom layers of the pyramid are forced to participate in the ladder climbing game whether they like it or not; or (2) the explosion in a certain layer of the pyramid created an imbalance between this layer and every single layer above it.

It's not difficult to imagine the issues that arose from this generational explosion of imbalance. In this situation however, I'd like to refer to it as **The Qualification Crisis**. When a certain layer exceeds the expected population, it creates a cascading wave of implicit competition within the population itself. It's an endless fight of who is more qualified to increase their social hierarchy to the next rank. The sad reality is those who got comfortable within a certain layer will most likely never be able to realize the situation they're in.

The competition to rise to a higher social hierarchical rank is entirely dependent on people who are otherwise at least one higher than you on the pyramid scale.

Relating back to the _Job Application_ issue, it's only a matter of time before people got tired of trying to enter the hierarchy climbing game. In a hierarchical social construct in the current world, for the system to be stable certain measures would need to be put in place. However, these measures would only be put on the bottom layers of the social construct. The power imbalance between the elites versus the commons will create a public outrage, and it's the very last thing the individuals in power would want to face.

College is not supposed to be a prerequisite for any kinds jobs. If a Bachelor's is now the new minimum qualification for jobs, should the government enforce a ruleset to make colleges to behave like high schools in the past? 12 years of education from elementary to high school is what most countries in the world. Would governments willingly take on a new obligation on themselves? This is the clash between the want for a flat social hierarchy versus a pyramid social hierarchy.
